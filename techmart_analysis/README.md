# üõí TechMart Sales Performance Analysis using SQL

TechMart, a leading retail company, is aiming to optimize its sales performance by leveraging structured data analysis. This project focuses on building a foundational SQL database and applying **window functions** and **ranking techniques** to evaluate product-level performance and monthly sales trends.

Through the creation of `Products` and `Sales` tables within a dedicated `sqlbasics` database, the analysis seeks to provide insights into top-performing products, purchasing patterns over time, and overall revenue contributors. These insights are key to driving **data-informed decisions** that enhance customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and improve inventory and product strategy.
