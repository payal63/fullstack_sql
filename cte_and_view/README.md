# üéì University Database Management with SQL Views

As the database administrator of a dynamic university environment, your role is pivotal in maintaining data integrity, accessibility, and meaningful insights across multiple academic operations. From managing course enrollments to tracking student academic progress, this project involves designing and manipulating **SQL views** to enhance reporting and streamline institutional workflows.

With structured tables for `Students`, `Courses`, `Instructors`, and `Enrolments`, you'll create views that not only track enrolment trends and faculty schedules but also support critical academic decisions like graduation eligibility and curriculum planning‚Äîan approach not unlike monitoring healthcare outcomes through dashboards, just tailored to an academic landscape.

## üß© Objectives

- Establish a relational schema representing the core operations of a university
- Insert realistic sample data into the following tables:
  - `Students`
  - `Courses`
  - `Instructors`
  - `Enrolments`
- Create and manage SQL views to support administrative reporting:
  - `CourseSummary`: Number of students enrolled per course
  - `InstructorSchedule`: Instructor course assignments by department
  - Modify and rename views dynamically to adapt to evolving academic requirements
  - `EligibleGraduates`: Identify high-performing students (GPA ‚â• 3.7)
- Implement CTE (`SemesterCourses`) to filter recent semester offerings
