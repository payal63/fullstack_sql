# üßë‚Äçüíº Employee Database Management & Analytics with SQL

In today‚Äôs dynamic business environment, maintaining a well-structured employee database is vital for operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. This project involves building and querying an **Employee Database** to derive meaningful insights from organizational data. It includes importing structured datasets, creating entity relationships, and applying complex SQL operations to perform performance evaluations, organizational audits, salary analysis, and data quality checks.

The project simulates real-world HR analytics tasks such as checking job-role validity, evaluating team structures, ranking employees by experience, and calculating performance-based bonuses.
