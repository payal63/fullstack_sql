# 👩‍💼 Employee Salary Analysis using SQL

This project involves designing and querying an employee database for XYZ organization, with a focus on exploring advanced SQL concepts such as **joins**, **subqueries**, and **set operations**. The goal is to analyze salary structures, identify top performers, and support strategic HR decisions to enhance organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction.

By building a structured employee table and performing salary-based analytics, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve decision-making related to resource allocation, performance evaluation, and cost optimization.

## 📁 Project Objectives

- Create a new SQL database named `XYZ`
- Design an `employee` table with the following fields:
  - `emp_id`, `f_name`, `l_name`, `job_id`, `salary`, `manager_id`, `dept_id`
- Insert a predefined set of employee records into the table
- Perform salary analysis using:
  - **Self Joins** – Identify employees earning more than a specific colleague
  - **Subqueries** – Retrieve employees with salaries above the average
  - **Set Operations** – Compare salaries across job IDs
  - **Joins + Subqueries** – Display top 3 highest-paid employees
